\begin{abstract}
We propose a non-contextual hidden variable model,
consistent with all \color{red} kinematic
predictions of quantum
mechanics (QM).  A careful scrutiny of consistency
requirements of any hidden variable model with
quantum mechanics and the corresponding no-go
theorems leads us to the conclusion that,
contrary to common belief,  the notion of
contextuality is not a necessary feature of Quantum Statics (QS).
The alternative view that emerges, hinges on
identifying a new classical property which we call
``multiplicativity''.  It turns out that by
relaxing this condition of ``multiplicativity'' on
hidden variable models, they can be made
consistent with QM  while remaining
non-contextual.  The connection of
non-``multiplicativity'' to Bohm's model and to
apparent contextuality is also discussed.

\maketitle
Quantum mechanics has been one of the most
successful theories in physics so far, however,
there has not yet been a final word on its
completeness and
interpretation~\cite{BellSpkblUnspkbl}.
Einstein's~\cite{EinsteinEPR} work on the
incompleteness of QM and the subsequent seminal
work of Bell~\cite{BellSpkblUnspkbl}, assessing
the compatibility of a more complete model
involving hidden variables (HV) and locality with
QM, has provided deep insights into  how the
quantum world differs from its classical
counterpart.  In recent times, these insights have
been of pragmatic utility in the area of quantum
information processing (QIP), where EPR pairs are
fundamental motifs of
entanglement~\cite{Ekert,PironioRndmnssCrtfcn,NielsenChuang}.
The work of  Kochen Specker~\cite{KochenSpecker}
and Gleason {\it
et.\,al.}~\cite{Gleason,Peres,Mermin} broadened
the schism between  HV models and QM.  They showed
that it was contextuality and not non-locality
which was at the heart of this schism and the
incompatibility between HV models and QM can arise
even for a single quantum system.  Contextuality
has thus been identified as a fundamental
non-classical feature of the quantum world and
experiments have also been proposed and conducted
to this effect~\cite{SimonContExpProp,
HuangContExp}.
Contextuality, on the one hand has
led to investigations on the foundational aspects
of QM including attempts to prove completeness of
QM~\cite{PawelCntxClsscl,CabelloMmryQM}, and on
the other hand has been harnessed for computation
and
cryptography~\cite{HowardCntxCmptn,CabelloCntxScrt}.
However, not all HV models (e.g.
Bohm's model based on
trajectories~\cite{Bohm1,Bohm2}) are incompatible
with QM~\cite{BellOnHiddenVariables}, and we in
this letter present a new non-contextual HV model
consistent with QM.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{block1}
\caption{Non-contextuality is not inconsistent
with QM} \label{fig:block}\end{figure}
A closer scrutiny of the arguments
leading to the dichotomy between QM and HV models
reveals that the algebraic constraints obeyed by
quantum observables may not necessarily be obeyed
by the predictions of an HV model at the level of
individual outcomes and  that contextuality is 
not a necessary feature of QM.  Those HV
models that obey such algebraic constraints
possess a special property which we call
``multiplicativity''.  Enlarging the scope of HV
models to include non-multiplicative models,
permits us to construct an explicit non-contextual
HV model consistent with 
{\color{red} kinematics predictions of}
QM (see \figref{block}).
The re-examination of the very proof of
`contextuality'  is used to illustrate
non-multiplicativity, an intrinsic quantum
feature, which we propose as a possible
alternative to contextuality. 
Non-mulitiplicativity thus might turn out to be
the key quantum feature distinguishing the quantum
world from the classical one and may have a role
to play in QIP protocols.  This provides a new
way to look at the classical-quantum divide and at
the foundations of quantum mechanics.

\begin{defn} A theory is non-contextual, if it

to explain measurement outcomes. A theory which is
not non-contextual is contextual~\cite{peresBook}.
\end{defn}

A prediction map of the form $M: \{
\hat{\mathcal{H}},[\mathcal{H}] \} \to\mathbb{R}$.
itself can be called  non-contextual.
\end{defnrem}
}
\begin{defnrem}
Broader definitions in the literature have been
suggested which declare a larger set of theories
as non-contextual~\cite{spekkens_pra}. For our
purposes, however, this restricted definition will
suffice  and our results will in any case be valid
for the broader definitions. The term contextual
is used to suggest that the value an observable
takes might depend on which other compatible
observable it is being  measured with.
\end{defnrem}
Before we re-examine the result of Kochen and
Specker~\cite{KochenSpecker} that non-contextual
models cannot be compatible with quantum
mechanics and show that multiplicativity can provide an
alternative to contextuality, we define
multiplicativity explicitly.
\begin{defn}
A prediction map $M$ is \emph{multiplicative} iff
\begin{align*} &
M(f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{N}),[\psi])
= \\ & \tilde
f(M(\hat{B}_{1},[\psi]),M(\hat{B}_{2},[\psi]),\dots
M(\hat{B}_{N},[\psi])), \end{align*}
where $\hat{B}_{i}\in\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ are
arbitrary mutually commuting observables and
$[\psi]\in[\mathcal{H}]$. A
\emph{non-multiplicative} map is one that is not
multiplicative.  
\end{defn} 
Note that if $M$ is taken to represent the
measurement outcome (in QM), then for states of
the system which are simultaneous eigenkets of
$\hat{B}_{i}$s, $M$ must clearly be
multiplicative. It is, however, not obvious that
this property must always hold. For example,
consider two spin-half particles in the state 
$\left|1\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle
$ written in the computational basis and 
operators 
$\hat{B}_{1}=\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}$,
$\hat{B}_{2}=\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}$
and
$\hat{C}=\hat{B}_{1}\hat{B}_{2}=-\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
written in terms of Pauli operators.
We must have $M(\hat{C})=-1$ while
$M(\hat{B}_{1})=\pm1$ and $M(\hat{B}_{2})=\pm1$
independently, according to QM, with probability
half. Here multiplicativity clearly is not
required to hold.
Antithetically, it is clear that if one first
measures $\hat{B}_{1}$ and subsequently measures
$\hat{B}_{2}$, then the product of the results
must be $-1$. This is consistent with measuring
$\hat{C}$. To capture this property we define
\emph{sequential multiplicativity} as follows.
\begin{defn} 
A prediction map $m$ is
\emph{sequentially multiplicative} for a given
sequence map $s$, iff \begin{align*}
&M(f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{N}),[\psi_{1}])=\\
&\tilde
f(M(\hat{B}_{1},[\psi_{k_{1}}]),M(\hat{B}_{2},[\psi_{k_{2}}]),\dots,M(\hat{B}_{N},[\psi_{k_{N}}])),
\end{align*} 
where
$\{k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{N}\} \in\{
N! {\rm ~permutations~of~}  k'{\rm s} \}$, 
$\hat{B}_{i}\in\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ are
arbitrary mutually commuting observables,
$[\psi_{i}]\in[\mathcal{H}]$ and
$[\psi_{k+1}] :=
S(\hat{B}_{k},[\psi_{k}],M(\hat{B}_{k},[\psi_{k}]))$,
$\forall\,[\psi_{i}]$.  
\label{defn:seqnMltpl}
\end{defn} 
With these definitions we are now ready to discuss
the `proof of contextuality'. We first state the
contextuality theorem in our notation:
\begin{thm*} Let a map
$M:\hat{\mathcal{H}}\to\mathbb{R}$, be s.t. (a)
$M(\hat{\mathbb{I}})=1$, (b)
$M(f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots))=\tilde
f(M(\hat{B}_{1}),M(\hat{B}_{2}),\dots)$, for any
arbitrary function $f$, where $\hat{B}_{i}$ are
mutually commuting Hermitian operators. If $m$ is
assumed to describe the outcomes of measurements,
then no $M$ exists which is consistent with all
predictions of QM. 
\label{thm:KS}
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof} Peres Mermin [PM]
($\left|\mathcal{H}\right|\ge4$)
\cite{Peres,Mermin}:
For a system composed of two spin-half particles 
consider the following set of operators \[
\hat{A}_{ij}\doteq\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} &
\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} &
\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} &
\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} &
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} &
\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} &
\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}
\end{array}\right] \] which have the property that
all operators along a row (or column) commute. Further,
the product of rows (or columns) yields
$\hat{R}_{i}=\hat{\mathbb{I}}$ and
$\hat{C}_{j}=\hat{\mathbb{I}}\,(j\neq3)$,
$\hat{C}_{3}=-\hat{\mathbb{I}}$, ($\forall\,i,j$) where
$\hat{R}_{i}:=\prod_{j}\hat{A}_{ij}$,
$\hat{C}_{j}:=\prod_{i}\hat{A}_{ij}$. Let us
assume that $M$ exists. From property (b) of the
map, to get $M(\hat{C}_{3})=-1$ (as required by
property (a)), we must have an odd number of $-1$
assignments in the third column. In the remaining
columns, the number of $-1$ assignments must be
even (for each column). Thus, in the entire
square, the number of $-1$ assignments must be
odd. Let us use the same reasoning, but along the
rows. Since each $M(\hat{R}_{i})=1$, we must have
even number of $-1$ assignments along each row.
Thus, in the entire square, the number of $-1$
assignments must be even. We have arrived at a
contradiction and therefore we conclude 
that $M$ does not exist
\end{proof}

\begin{rem} One could in principle assume $M$, to
be s.t. (a) $M(\hat{\mathbb{I}})=1$, (b)
$M(\alpha\hat{B}_{i})=\alpha M(\hat{B}_{i})$, for
$\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, (c)
$M(\hat{B}_{i}^{2})=M(\hat{B}_{i})^{2}$, (d)
$M(\hat{B}_{i}+\hat{B}_{j})=M(\hat{B}_{i})+M(\hat{B}_{j})$,
to deduce (d)
$M(\hat{B}_{i}\hat{B}_{j})=M(\hat{B}_{i})M(\hat{B}_{j})$
and that $M(\hat{B}_{i})\in$ spectrum of
$\hat{B}_{i}$. Effectively then, condition (b)
listed in the theorem is satisfied as a
consequence.  Therefore, assuming (a)-(d) as
listed above, rules out a larger class of
$M$~\cite{KochenSpecker}.
\end{rem} 
Here $M$ maybe viewed as a specific class of
prediction maps, that implicitly depends on the
state $[\psi]$. It is clear that according to the
theorem, non-contextual maps which are
\emph{multiplicative} must be incompatible with
QM. 
This leaves open an interesting possibility
that non-contextual maps which are
non-\emph{multiplicative} could be consistent with
QM. We explicitly construct such an HV model and use
\emph{sequential multiplicativity} as a consistency
check imposed by QM.
\begin{prop*} 
Let a quantum mechanical 
system be in a state, s.t. measurement of
$\hat{C}$ yields repeatable results (same result
each time). Then according to QM, \emph{sequential
multiplicativity} holds, where $\hat{C}:=
f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n})$, and
$\hat{B}_{i}$ are as defined (in \defnref{seqnMltpl})
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof} 
Without loss of generality we can take
$\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n}$ to be
mutually compatible and a complete set of
observables (operators can be added to make the set
complete if needed).
It follows
that $\exists$
$\left|\mathbf{b}=\left(b_{1},b_{2},\dots
b_{n}\right)\right\rangle $ s.t.
$\hat{B}_{i}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle
=b_{i}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $,
and that
$\sum_{\mathbf{b}}\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle
\left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|=\hat{\mathbb{I}}$.
Let the state of the system
$\left|\psi\right\rangle $ be s.t.
$\hat{C}\left|\psi\right\rangle
=c\left|\psi\right\rangle $. For
the statement to follow, one need only show that
$\left|\psi\right\rangle $ must be made of only
those $\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $s, which
satisfy $c=\tilde
f(b_{1},b_{2},\dots
b_{n})$.  This is the crucial step and
proving this is straightforward. We start with
$\hat{C}\left|\psi\right\rangle
=c\left|\psi\right\rangle $ and take its inner
product with $\left\langle \mathbf{b}\right|$ to
get 
\begin{eqnarray*} 
c \langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\rangle 
& = &
\langle
\mathbf{b} |\hat{C} |\psi
\rangle  
\\
&=&
\langle
\mathbf{b}| f(\hat{B}_{1},\hat{B}_{2},\dots\hat{B}_{n}) |
\psi \rangle
\\ 
&=&
\tilde f (b_{1},b_{2},\dots b_{n})
\langle
\mathbf{b}|\psi\rangle  
\end{eqnarray*}
Also, we have $\left|\psi\right\rangle
=\sum_{\mathbf{b}}\left\langle
\mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle
\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $, from
completeness. If we consider
$\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $s for which
$\left\langle \mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle \neq0$,
then we find that indeed $c=\tilde
f(b_{1},b_{2},\dots
b_{n})$. The case when $\left\langle
\mathbf{b}|\psi\right\rangle =0$ is anyway
irrelevant as the corresponding $\vert b\rangle$
does not contribute to $\vert \psi\rangle$.
We can thus conclude that
$\left|\psi\right\rangle $ is made only of those
$\left|\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $s that satisfy the
required relation.
\end{proof} 
It is worth noting that in the Peres Mermin
case, where $\hat{R}_{i}$ and $\hat{C}_{j}$ are
$\pm\hat{\mathbb{I}}$, it follows that all
states are their eigenstates. Consequently, for
these operators \emph{sequential multiplicativity}
must always hold.
%\subsection{C-ingle model | An Explicit
%Construction \label{ssec:cingle}}



We are now ready to describe our 
model explicitly.
Let the state of a finite dimensional quantum
system be $\left|\chi\right\rangle $. We wish to
assign a value to an arbitrary observable
$\hat{A}=\sum_{a}a\left|a\right\rangle
\left\langle a\right|$, which has eigenvectors $\{
\vert a_j\rangle \}$. The corresponding ordered
eigenvalues are $\{a_j\}$ such that $a_{\rm
min}=a_1$ and $a_{\rm max}=a_n$.  Our HV model for
QM assigns values in the following three steps:
\setdefaultleftmargin{0pt}{}{}{}{}{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf  Initial HV:} Pick a number
$c\in[0,1]$, from a uniform random distribution.\
\item
{\bf
Assignment or Prediction:}
 The value assigned to
$\hat{A}$ is given by finding the smallest $a$
s.t.  $c\le\sum_{a'=a_{\text{min}}}^{a}\left|\left\langle
a'|\chi\right\rangle \right|^{2},$ viz. we have
specified a prediction map, $M(\hat{A},[\chi ])=a$.
\item
{\bf  Update:} After measuring an operator, the state is
updated (collapsed) in accordance with the rules
of QM. This completely specifies the sequence map
$S$.
\end{enumerate}
The above HV model works for all quantum systems,
however, to illustrate its working,
consider the example of a spin-half particle in the state
$\left|\chi\right\rangle
=\cos\theta\left|0\right\rangle
+\sin\theta\left|1\right\rangle $ and the observable
$\hat{A}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}=\left|0\right\rangle
\left\langle 0\right|-\left|1\right\rangle
\left\langle 1\right|$. Now, according to the
postulates of this theory, $M(\hat{A},[\chi])=+1$
if
the randomly generated value for 
$c\le\cos^{2}\theta$ else $\hat{A}$ is assigned
$-1$; it then follows,  from $c$ being uniformly
random in $[0,1]$ that the statistics agree with
the predictions of QM {\it i.e.}  the
Born rule. 
The assignment described by the
prediction map $M$ is non-contextual since, given
an operator and a state (alongwith the HV $c$), the value is
uniquely assigned. The map $M$ is, however,
non-multiplicative.


To bring out the non-multiplicativity of our model 
explicitly and to show its
applicability to composite systems,
we apply the model to the Peres Mermin situation of two
spin-half particles. Consider the initial state of
the system 
$\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle
=\left|00\right\rangle $. Assume we 
obtained $c=0.4$ as a random choice. To arrive
at the assignments, note that
$\left|00\right\rangle $ is an eigenket of only
$\hat{R}_{i},\hat{C}_{j}$ and
$\hat{A}_{33}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$.
Thus, in the first iteration, all these should be
assigned their respective eigenvalues. The
remaining operators must be assigned $-1$ as one
can readily verify by explicitly finding the
smallest $a$ as described in postulate 2 of the
model (see \tblref{HVmodel}). 



For the next iteration, $i=2$, 
after the first measurement is over
say the random number generator yielded the value $c=0.1$.
Since $\left|\psi\right\rangle $ is also
unchanged
the assignment remains invariant (in fact any of
$c<0.5$ would yield the same result as
evident from the previous exercise). For the
final step we choose to measure
$\hat{A}_{23}(=\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y})$,
to proceed with sequentially measuring
$\hat{C}_{3}$. To simplify calculations, we note
$\left|00\right\rangle
=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \left[ \left(\left|\tilde{+}\tilde{-}\right\rangle
+\left|\tilde{-}\tilde{+}\right\rangle
\right)/\sqrt{2}+\left(\left|\tilde{+}\tilde{+}\right\rangle
+\left|\tilde{-}\tilde{-}\right\rangle
\right)/\sqrt{2}\right] , 
$
with
$\left|\tilde{\pm}\right\rangle
=\left|0\right\rangle \pm i\left|1\right\rangle $
(eigenkets of $\hat{\sigma}_{y}$). Since
$\left|00\right\rangle$ is manifestly not an
eigenket of $\hat A_{23}$, we must find an appropriate
eigenket $\left|a^-_{23}\right\rangle $ s.t.
$\hat A_{23}\left|a^{-}_{23}\right\rangle
=-\left|a^{-}_{23}\right\rangle $, since $c=0.1$ and
$\left\langle a_{23}^{-}|00\right\rangle $ is already
$>0.1$. It is evident that
$\left|a^{-}_{23}\right\rangle
=\left(\left|\tilde{+}\tilde{-}\right\rangle
+\left|\tilde{-}\tilde{+}\right\rangle
\right)/\sqrt{2}=\left(\left|00\right\rangle
+\left|11\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$, which
becomes the final state. 


For the final
iteration, $i=3$, say we obtain $c=0.7$. So far,
we have $M_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})=1$ and
$M_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})=-1$. We must obtain
$M_{3}(\hat{A}_{13})=1$, independent of the value
of $c$, to be consistent. Let us check that.
Indeed, according to postulate 2, since
$\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\left(\left|00\right\rangle
+\left|11\right\rangle
\right)/\sqrt{2}=1\left(\left|00\right\rangle
+\left|11\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$,
$M_{3}(\hat{A}_{13})=1$ for all allowed values of
$c$. It is to be noted that
$M_{2}(\hat{A}_{33})=M_{3}(\hat{A}_{33})$ and
$M_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})=M_{3}(\hat{A}_{23})$, which
essentially expresses the compatibility of these
observables; i.e. 
once measured, the values of observables compatible
with $\hat{A}_{13}$ are not affected by the 
measurement of $\hat{A}_{13}$.

The \emph{non-multiplicativity} is
manifest, for $M_{1}(\hat{C}_{3})=1\neq
M_{1}(\hat{A}_{13})M_{1}(\hat{A}_{23})M_{1}(\hat{A}_{33})=-1$,
where the subscript refers to the iteration
number.  More precisely,
$M_{1}(\hat{O}):=M(\hat{O},\left[\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle
=\left|00\right\rangle \right])$ where the
complete state $\left[\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle
\right]$ implicitly refers to both the quantum
state $\left|00\right\rangle $ and the HV $c=0.4$.
The model, however, obeys the \emph{sequential
multiplicativity} as required for consistency,
namely,
$M_{1}(\hat{C}_{3})=M_{1}
(\hat{A}_{33})M_{2}(\hat{A}_{23})M_{3}(\hat{A}_{13})$,
where
$M_{2}:=M(\hat{O},\left[\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle
\right])$,
$M_{3}:=M(\hat{O},\left[\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle
\right])$ and $\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle
,\,\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle $ are obtained from
postulate 3. Note that for each iteration, a new
HV is generated. To illustrate \emph{sequential
multiplicativity}, we must choose to measure
$\hat{A}_{33}$. According to step 3, since
$\left|00\right\rangle $ is an eigenstate of
$\hat{A}_{33}$, the final state remains
$\left|00\right\rangle $.  


Non-multiplicativity has implications to Bohm's HV
model (BHVM), where if the initial conditions are
precisely known the entire trajectory of a
particle (guided by the wavefunction) can be
predicted including the individual outcome of
measurements.  BHVM applied to a single spin-half
particle in a Stern-Gerlach experiment, can
predict opposite results for two measurements of
the same operator.  This observation which is
often used as a demonstration of `contextuality'
in BM, does not even inolve  overlapping sets of
compatible measurements to provide two different
contexts~\cite{HardyCntxBM}.  It turns out that,
if one constructs  a one-one map between an
experiment and an observable (by following a
certain convention), the so-called `contextuality'
can be removed from BHVM.  However, the prediction
map so obtained from observables to measurement
outcomes turns out to be non-multiplicative,
suggesting that non-multiplicativity is a more
suitable explanation of non-classicality
of BHVM.



We illustrate how non-multiplicativity gives rise
to situations which could get confused with the
presence of contextuality.  Imagine for two sping
1/2 particles
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\hat{B}_{1}\!=\!\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}}\!=\!
\left|00\right\rangle
\left\langle 00\right|+\left|01\right\rangle
\left\langle 01\right|-\left[\left|10\right\rangle
\left\langle 10\right|+\left|11\right\rangle
\left\langle 11\right|\right], \\
&&\hat{B}_{2}\!=\!\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}\!=\!
\left|10\right\rangle
\left\langle 10\right|+\left|11\right\rangle
\left\langle 11\right|-\left[\left|00\right\rangle
\left\langle 00\right|+\left|01\right\rangle
\left\langle 01\right|\right], \\
&&\hat{C}=f(\{\hat{B}_{i}\}) \\
&&\quad=1.\left|00\right\rangle \left\langle
00\right|+2.\left|01\right\rangle \left\langle
01\right|+3.\left|10\right\rangle \left\langle
10\right|+4.\left|11\right\rangle \left\langle
11\right|. 
\end{eqnarray*}
$\hat{C}$ maybe viewed as a function of
$\hat{B}_{1}$, $\hat{B}_{2}$ and other operators
$\hat{B}_{i}$ which are constructed to obtain a
maximally commuting set. A measurement of
$\hat{C}$, will collapse the state into one of the
states which are simultaneous eigenkets of
$\hat{B}_{1}$ and $\hat{B}_{2}$. Consequently,
from the observed value of $\hat{C}$, one can
deduce the values of $\hat{B}_{1}$ and
$\hat{B}_{2}$. Now consider
$\sqrt{2}\left|\chi\right\rangle
=\left|10\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle $,
for which $M_{1}(\hat{B}_{1})=1$, and
$M_{1}(\hat{B}_{2})=1$, using our model, with
$c<0.5$. However, $M_{1}(\hat{C})=1$, from which
one can deduce that $\hat{B}_{1}$ was $+1$, while
$\hat{B}_{2}$ was $-1$.  This property itself, one
may be tempted call contextuality, viz.  the value
of $\hat{B}_{1}$ depends on whether it is measured
alone or with the remaining $\{\hat{B}_{i}\}$.
However, it must be noted that $\hat{B}_{1}$ has a
well defined value, and so does $\hat{C}$. Thus by
our accepted definition, there is no
contextuality. It is just that $M_{1}(\hat{C})\neq
\tilde
f(M_{1}(\hat{B}_{1}),M_{1}(\hat{B}_{2}),\dots)$,
viz. the theory is non-multiplicative. Note that
after measuring $\hat{C}$, however,
$M_{2}(\hat{B}_{1})=+1$ and
$M_{2}(\hat{B}_{2})=-1$ (for any value of $c$)
consistent with those deduced by measuring
$\hat{C}$.  Evidently, multiplicativity must hold
for the common eigenkets of $\hat{B}_{i}$'s.
Consequently, any violation of multiplicativity
must arise from states that are super-positions or
linear combinations of these eigenkets. 


Clearly, entanglement is not necessary to have a
non-multiplicative situation; for instance the
Peres Mermin test is a state independent test
where a separable state can be used to arrive at a
contradiction. On the other hand if everyting is
multiplicative in a situation, can we have
violation of Bell's inequality or non-locality?
The answer is no and therefore, one can say that
Bell's inequalities bring out  non-local
consequences of  non-multiplicative prediction
maps and the notion of non-multiplicativity is
more basic.  


In this letter we have presented
non-multiplicativity as an alternative to
contextuality and as an essential signature of
quantumness at the kinematic level.  We expect
this to provide new insights that will be useful
in the areas of foundations of QM and QIP.
{\color{red} Implications of quantum dynamics for
our model and in general for the notion of
non-multiplicativity needs to be explored
further.}
